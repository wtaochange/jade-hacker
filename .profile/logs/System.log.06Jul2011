[22:35] -G (announce@undernet.org) to $*- It has come to our attention that some users are impersonating Cservice officials and directing people to a fake website in order to steal their usernames. Please note that our official website is http://cservice.undernet.org/ and do not give out your username's password or use the same password on any other site. The website is currently unavailable due to ongoing severe DDoS attacks,
[22:36] -G (announce@undernet.org) to $*- however work is in progress on it and we hope to have the site available again soon. Thank you for your patience as we try to find a solution.
