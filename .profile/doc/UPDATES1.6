ReBEL     guppy     Increased the length of ban reasons from 65 to 160 (I

          Fabian    Avoid data lossage during the start of connections, while

                    set to 0.

                    clear_chanlist() with a specialised loop.
labtec    guppy     Instead of telnet!*@* we now use -telnet!*@* since no valid
