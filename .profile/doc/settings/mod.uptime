                               Uptime Module


  This module reports uptime statistics to http://uptime.eggheads.org. Go look
  and see what your uptime is! It takes about 9 hours to show up, so if your
  bot isn't listed, try again later.

  Information sent to the server includes the bot's uptime, botnet-nick,
  server, version, and IP address. This information is stored in a temporary
  logfile for debugging purposes only. The only publicly available information
  will be the bot's botnet-nick, version and uptime. If you do not wish for
  this information to be sent, comment out the 'loadmodule uptime' line in your
  bot's config file.

  This module requires: server

  Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the uptime
  module:

    loadmodule uptime
